\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

StackExchange is a collection of 110 questions and answer sites on diverse topics from programming to cooking to photography and gaming. \citep{stackexchange2013site}.
Regarding this, Facebook \citep{facebook2013site} has created an online recruiting competition in Kaggle \citep{kaggle013site} that has the aim of ``Identify keywords and tags from millions of text questions'' \citep{facebook2013keyword}.
Facebook provided a Train and a Test dataset with real questions from the Stack Overflow \citep{stackoverflow2013site}, a StackExchange's site that contain topics from programming languages and computer science.
The task is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries) given only the question text and its title.

Accordingly, a Bayesian Data Analysis was proposed in this project to predict the tags.
With this in mind, the train dataset was used to calculate the prior information, the likelihood values, and the evidence of a given question.
